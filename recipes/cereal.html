        <p><strong>The Ultimate Late Night Snack</strong></p>

        <p>There's nothing better than going into your kitchen at 3am after finishing up some work and getting yourself a nice big bowl of cereal. It may seem like a recipe isn't necessary for this, but trust me, you may have been eating cereal <strong> WRONG </strong> your entire life.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Your choice of cereal</li>
            <li>Your choice of milk</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is where cereal gets real <em>tricky</em></p>

        <ol>
            <li>The <strong> first </strong> step you should do, is pour your cereal into a bowl! (Not milk first, but CEREAL)</li>
            <li>After you have your desired amount of cereal, then pour milk into bowl</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The instructions strictly state cereal should be poured first, our food scientists have discovered that the best way to enjoy cereal is when the milk has slightly soaked into the cereal, which is more ensured when being poured over. That being said, once you have finished your cereal and there is leftover milk, it is okay at this time and only at this time can you pour cereal on top of your milk.</p>
